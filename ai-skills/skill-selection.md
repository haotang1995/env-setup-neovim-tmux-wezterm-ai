# Skill Selection Tracker

Generated: 2026-02-13

Use this to mark whether each skill should stay installed.

## Status Legend

- `TBD`: not reviewed yet
- `KEEP`: keep installed
- `REMOVE`: remove from installed set

## Local Review Options

### Option 1: Interactive Reviewer (recommended)

Use the script to review skills one-by-one with `y/n/q` prompts:

```bash
python3 scripts/review_skills.py
```

Useful variants:

```bash
# Review one specific skill
python3 scripts/review_skills.py --skill openai-docs

# Re-ask only skills that already have decisions
python3 scripts/review_skills.py --redo

# Record decisions only (do not apply symlink changes immediately)
python3 scripts/review_skills.py --no-apply
```

This updates `ai-skills/skill-decisions.json`. By default, each answer is
applied immediately to `~/.claude/skills`, `~/.codex/skills`, and
`~/.gemini/skills`.

### Option 2: Manual Notes in This File

You can still edit this tracker manually (`TBD`/`KEEP`/`REMOVE`) for planning
and rationale, but the source of truth for enforcement is
`ai-skills/skill-decisions.json`.
